# Dealer Engine

Dealer Engine is a utility designed to assist lot-service vendors with billing their client dealerships.

It aggregates billable data from multiple IMS vendors, corrects common billing mistakes made at the time of service, and generates formatted PDF invoices which may then be sent to the client.
